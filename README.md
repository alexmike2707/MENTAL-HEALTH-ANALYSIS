# MENTAL-HEALTH-ANALYSIS
I recently conducted exploratory data analysis on a data set concerning  mental health diagnosis , and also build predictive model on how its psychological features can be used to determine if a person requires just counseling or he/she need to be treated.  
About Dataset
This dataset appears to contain a variety of features related to text analysis, sentiment analysis, and psychological indicators, likely derived from posts or text data. Some features include readability indices such as Automated Readability Index (ARI), Coleman Liau Index, and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, as well as sentiment analysis scores like sentiment compound, negative, neutral, and positive scores. Additionally, there are features related to psychological aspects such as economic stress, isolation, substance use, and domestic stress. The dataset seems to cover a wide range of linguistic, psychological, and behavioural attributes, potentially suitable for analyzing mental health-related topics in online communities or text data.
